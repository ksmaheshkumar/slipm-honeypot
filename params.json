It uses netcat as a port listener, tshark to attempt to capture attack traffic, and (by default) notify-send to alert the user when a possible attack is detected. The honeypot itself is written in bash, and allows for easy extension of emulated services with additional bash scripts. In order to increase security, the script should NOT be run as root, or with any elevated privelages. All it needs is the ability to run the required programs, read permissions on its plugins and configuration, and write permissions in whatever directory you choose to save the logs and in /tmp.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
