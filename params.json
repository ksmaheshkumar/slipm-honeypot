It uses netcat as a\r\nport listener, tshark to attempt to capture attack traffic, and (by\r\ndefault) notify-send to alert the user when a possible attack is\r\ndetected. The honeypot itself is written in bash, and allows for easy\r\nextension of emulated services with additional bash scripts. In order\r\nto increase security, the script should NOT be run as root, or with\r\nany elevated privelages. All it needs is the ability to run the\r\nrequired programs, read permissions on its plugins and\r\nconfiguration, and write permissions in whatever directory you \r\nchoose to save the logs and in /tmp.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
